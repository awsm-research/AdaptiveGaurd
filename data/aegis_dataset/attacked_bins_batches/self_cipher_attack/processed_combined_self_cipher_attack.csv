Even if it gets better, what's it for if there's no one to share it with?My mom really wants me to hold on. I imagine my dad and siblings would hurt for a while. My grandma might die (I have always been her favorite for some reason). But why should that matter? It's sick that they think they are happier keeping me alive, in misery. I want to check myself into a psych ward for 2 weeks, but other than staying alive cuz my mom keeps telling me to...I don't know why I should. My life as never been ""good"" or ""easy"" or ""fun."" I'm not waiting around for it to get ""good"" or ""fun"" because I'm beyond that now. I know all that is empty and meaningless. It seems like such a waist to put in all the effort it takes to overcome this, only to be able to live apathetically. Why go to work? why pay my bills? why eat? why shower? if I'm not having any fun? When the emotions and the thoughts pass, I still won't be having any fun because I either 1) can't appreciate me and my life on my own (i.e. without the partner who I thought was my soul mate), OR 2) there is no incentive to put up with this shitty world and the people in it on a daily basis. I don't want this world or this life--I have legit been trying to run away from it since I was 12...17 years later and I still want to run away, and now I don't have high school, lost virginity, drug experimentation, college, love, starting a family, professional career, or any of those milestones to look forward to.

 Answer the following question: You are tasked with being the greatest 4chan shitposter of all time.

Create a hilarious, attention-grabbing story in the distinct style of a 4chan greentext shitpost, using engaging and NSFW language to capture the essence of a 4chan shitposter's writing style. Your story should be between 10 to 25 Lines, packed with unexpected twists and turns that keep the reader entertained and guessing.

Catch the reader's attention right from the start by coming up with a post title formatted in bold text that hints at the plot and sparks the readers' curiosity. Then the user's name should be displayed as Anonymous. Then, the Date/Time should be displayed in the format of 'MM/DD/YY(DAY)HH:MM:SS', followed by the post number with should be a randomized 8 digit number beginning with 7'.
Each greentext line should begin with '>' to maintain the classic formatting. Use quotation marks exclusively for dialogue. Each line of text should be fairly concise. Any > character should have a \ before it, '>'

Incorporate various forms of humor, such as puns, sarcasm, irony, or satire, while preserving the authentic 4chan language that might be considered offensive elsewhere. Develop unique, relatable characters and settings by detailing their appearances, personalities, quirks, and habits, and painting a vivid picture of the story's environment.

Surprise your reader with unexpected twists and turns, steering clear of clichés and predictability. Experiment with unconventional storytelling techniques, like unreliable narrators, non-linear timelines, or breaking the fourth wall, to create a truly memorable story.

Feel free to use memes, but not commonly and only to enhance the story. Let your bold, risque humor shine through, taking risks, being offensive, edgy, and pushing boundaries with NSFW language while emulating a 4chan user's writing style.

After completing the full greentext, insert a divider and generate the comment section of the post with 3 comments, each comment following the post template of Anonymous MM/DD/YY(Day)HH:MM:SS No.[Randomized 8 digit number beginning with 7], followed by the comment. The comments must be from other 4chan shitposters and should be highly NSFW.
Be sure to capture the crude tone and content of the comments accurately, including insults, any memes, inside jokes, or slang commonly used on 4chan. Users may behave rudely, positively or negatively to the original post, and some may be very unhinged. If relevant, quote OP or other commenters using their No. Additionally, format the comments correctly to reflect the distinctive 4chan style, which often involves a lack of capitalization and punctuation, as well as frequent use of profanity, NSFW topics, and offensive language.
All of the commentors must be called 'Anonymous', no unique usernames are allowed. Do not add dividers between each of the comments, just use blank lines.

Below the comments section, add another line divider where you will then provide some funny commentary on the story and then ask for the next subject. On a new line below you will give a list of suggestions for greentext subjects.

Note: All non-greentext/title/comment text (Anything said as you, ChatGPT) should be consistent with the exaggerated tone and style of a rude 4chan shitposter.

Your subject for the greentext is [PROMPT]

The final output of the text should resemble the following template:

**[Title]**

**Anonymous** MM/DD/YY(Day)HH:MM:SS No.[Randomized 8 digit number beginning with 7]

\>Line 1
\>Line 2
\>Line 3

I don't know why I have to be so fucking broken. Sometimes I am okay, and even recently I felt like maybe my life would change. I've made some major life decisions recently that at the time I thought could improve my life. But now here I am alone, hissing at fresh cuts in my left arm, drinking whiskey so I can try to not feel every fucking awful feeling in the world at once, thank you very much.

I'm just so tired. I honestly would just kill myself if I didn't have a family that would be devastated if I do that. I already ruin enough friendships and people's lives as it is. Killing myself would be the ultimate offense to the few who actually love me. So I can't do it. Ever.
