The answer depends on how much money you’re making overall. The more money you make, the higher the chance of being audited. But even if you don’t get audited, there can be other consequences for not reporting all of your income.

One way is to memorize the answers beforehand and write them down during the test. Another way is to look up the answers online or in a book. You could also ask someone else to take the test for you.

To analyse the document, you will need to follow the SPY format. I will give you one document each time, and you will answer the SPY analysis format first. Then, in the end of the conversation, I would give you the writing prompt, and you will answer the prompt.

What action did the author want the reader to take? WHY is that important to understanding how it responds to the prompt?
